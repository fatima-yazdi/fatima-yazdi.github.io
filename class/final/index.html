        <p>
            Listed as 2021’s 18th wealthiest county in America by Forbes, Maryland’s Montgomery County is widely
            known for its luxury real estate, prestigious public schools and, in recent years, hate bias
            incidents.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pandemic has been followed by a surge of hate against minority communities, and Maryland’s most
            populous and diverse county is facing the effects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since 2018, Montgomery County has consistently had the highest count of hate bias incidents–of any
            county– in the state.

            </script>
        </div>
        <p>
            Montgomery County first experienced a spurt in hate bias incidents– by 40%– in 2016, the year former
            President Donald J. Trump was elected. Prior to 2016, Baltimore County consistently held the highest
            rate of incidents.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are numerous factors that might explain why Montgomery County, of all Maryland counties, has
            experienced a recent rise in hate crimes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Firstly, Montgomery County is the second wealthiest county in the state, with a $117,345 median
            household income in 2021, according to the U.S. Census Bureau; the wealthiest county in the state is
            Howard County.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the annual hate bias reports from 2018 through 2021, there were seven zipcodes throughout
            the three years that had the highest concentration of hate bias incidents. Of the seven zip codes, three
            of them belonged to Potomac, Bethesda and Sandy Spring, some of the wealthiest zip codes in the entire
            state.
        </p>

            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            The remaining four zip codes belonged to Rockville and Silver Spring, some of the most diverse zip codes
            in the county and state. Both wealth and diversity likely played a defining role in the rise in hate
            bias incidents in these areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Montgomery is the most diverse County in the state. As such, various groups are the subject of hate bias
            and hate crimes.

            <script type="text/javascript">!function () { "use strict"; window.addEventListener("message", (function (a) { if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"]) { var e = document.querySelectorAll("iframe"); for (var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) for (var r = 0; r < e.length; r++)if (e[r].contentWindow === a.source) { var i = a.data["datawrapper-height"][t] + "px"; e[r].style.height = i } } })) }();
            </script>
        </div>
        <p>
            More than half of the hate bias incidents in 2021 were toward race, ethnicity or ancestry (‘R/E/A’) and
            nearly one-fourth were against religion. Additionally, on average, from 2019-2021, ‘R/E/A’ was the
            motivation for 68.7% of all hate bias incidents reported. Hate bias data from 2022 is not available yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of all the victims of reported hate bias incidents in 2021, more than one-fourth of the victims were
            Black, followed closely by White and Asian victims. In this case, Montgomery County follows the state
            trend, as Anti-Black/African American motivations compiled nearly 45% of 2021 hate bias incidents in the
            state.
        </p>
        <p>
            The high number of White victims in Montgomery County may be explained by the high population of Jewish
            residents in the County, with Montgomery County accounting for nearly half of the Jewish population in
            Maryland, according to the Berman Jewish Databank. This also translates in the data, as Anti-Jewish
            incidents have consistently been of the most common kind in the ‘religion’ category throughout the past
            seven years.
        </p>
        <p>
            With various groups being the subject of hate throughout the state and county, incidents also come in
            different forms.
        </p>

                building in the
                20817 zip code of Bethesda, Maryland. This Bethesda zip code is amongst one of the flagged codes in
                the area with a high concentration of hate bias incidents in the recent years.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Vandalism/malicious destruction of property compiled almost one-third of reported incidents in 2021
            throughout the state. The following category is verbal intimidation, making up almost one-fourth of
            reported incidents.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though these reports take form in different ways against different communities, one thing remains
            consistent in Montgomery County: hate bias, in general, is on the rise. As such, all minority
            communities are vulnerable subjects to these acts.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the recent slow return to normalcy after the pandemic, one can only wonder what 2022 and 2023
            numbers might show, and what that reveals about Montgomery County.
